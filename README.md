- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dev and here you can find examples of my work and projects I'm working on

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Data Science and how statistical techniques, coupled with the right questions, can help explain the meaning of the data.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and SQL

- I will primarily upload pieces of analysis/evidence of techniques used in Python/SQL, as-well as personal projects.
